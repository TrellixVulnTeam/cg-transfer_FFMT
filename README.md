# A Scaling Law for Synthetic-to-Real Transfer: A Measure of Pre-Training

This repository is the official implementation of [A Scaling Law for Synthetic-to-Real Transfer: A Measure of Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx). 

This repository contains the code to generate synthetic images, the results for reproducing the plots, and pre-trained models. 


## Generation of Synthetic Images

To generate synthetic images/annotations we used in the experiments, see `rendering` directory.

## Results

To check the accuracy scores of various pre-training/fine-tuning task pairs, see `results` directory. 

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pre-trained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z.
